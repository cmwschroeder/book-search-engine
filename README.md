# Book Search Engine

## Description

On this website we use graphql to handle all requests between client side and server side. You can create an account and login through mutations, save and remove books from your account through mutations, and view all your saved book through a query. There is an API request to google books to get their books but everything else is handled in this site. This site utilizes jwt to handle presistent login. Just log in and start searching and saving!
